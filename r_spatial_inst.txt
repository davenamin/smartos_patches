for rgeos, consider exporting LIBS="-lstdc++"....

If you use OS X with the Homebrew package manager, and have R installed through the homebrew-science tap, you can install rgdal by first installing gdal.

brew install gdal

You may first want to list the options available before you run this in case you want something fancy like postgresql support. To see the available options type

brew options gdal

then to be fancy you can type

brew install --with-postgresql gdal

after a while you should be good to go with dependencies, since proj including your needed proj_api.h are dependencies! Unfortunately, rgdal still won't find pro_api.h right now since it isn't looking in /usr/local/include. To fix this and other possible maladies with your rgdal installation, use the following R command to install rgdal:

  > install.packages('rgdal', type = "source", configure.args=c('--with-proj-include=/usr/local/include','--with-proj-lib=/usr/local/lib'))

This should be similar to what you would also need for MacPorts with the exception of the brew steps, and your libraries/headers are most likely under "/opt/local/lib" and "/opt/local/include" respectively.
